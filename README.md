This repository contains an implementation of a Linear Regression model utilizing Scikit-Learn for dataset analysis, model performance evaluation, and result visualization. The project involves several key steps: importing and preprocessing the dataset to ensure readiness for modeling, splitting the data into training and testing sets for effective evaluation, fitting a Linear Regression model to learn the relationship between features and target values, evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²), and finally plotting the regression line to interpret coefficients and understand the model's fit. The project requires dependencies including Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Seaborn.
